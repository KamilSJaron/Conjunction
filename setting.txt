# The syntax is "NAMEofPARAMETER = VALUE;". Change only VALUE, correct reading of this file by simulation program is depended on it.
# all the parameters are set to the default values, range of the reasonable values is in comment after every parameter in the format [min,max]
# values out of recommended range are allowed, but without guarantee of successful simulation

#PROBABILITYmap = [0.2, 0.6, 0.2] # gives probabilities of chiasma rolled between loci, default is [0, 1/(LOCI-1), ..., 1/(LOCI-1), 0], where length of vector always has to be LOCI + 1, otherwise the defult is used

# World definition

#parameter WORLDdefinition set up the space for the simulation. There are several options of definition, use only one definition per simulation.
#the easiest is to chose one of the quick pre-defined worlds described in manual using label -quick

WORLDdefinition -quick = 'HybridZone' 1 # ['HybridZone','LowMigrationBazykin','InfInf','Arena','WorldLike'], the number is height of the hybrid zone, or size of squared arena or world, integer in [1 to 25].
# note, that 1D HybridZone can me made by setting height to 1.
# if the size of arena / world-like is odd, the middle line of demes will be filled equally by individuals of 'a' and 'b' population

#standard description IS NOT WORKING YET
#standard description is in following format (note, it is definig same world as default quick option)
#WORLDdefinition -standard = 'extending' 2 'wrapping' 3 #type of left/right border ['extending','absorbing','wrapping','infinity'], number of demes from left to right boarder at begining, the same with up/down
