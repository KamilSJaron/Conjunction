# this file serves as setting for the program forsim, if the file is missing in directory, the program returns error 
# # is the comment symbol, everything after # will be ignored, do not hesitate to write down notes
# The syntax is "NAMEofPARAMETER = VALUE;". Change only VALUE, correct reading of this file by simulation program is depended on it.
# all the parameters are set to the default values, range of the reasonable values is in comment of every parameter in the format [min,max]
# values out of recommended range are allowed, but without guarantee of successful simulation


RESOLUTION = 101 # number of loci per chromosome, integer in [1;10000]
NUMBERofCHROMOSOMES = 20 # integer in [1;21]
RECOMBINATIONrate = 1 # real number in [0;5]
SELECTIONpressure = 0.5 # real number in [0;1]
BETA = 1 # real number in [0;16]
DEMEsize = 512 # integer in [4;2048], use only power of 4, otherwise the plots wont be nice.
