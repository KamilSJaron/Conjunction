# forsim
C++ software for forward simualtion

This software is in development (obviously). 
It is main part of the master thesis of mine and it is simulator of genomic admixture on the hybrid zones.

Sometimes I am commiting changes, which leads to difunctionality of program by comenting some computations in main (if it is not relevant to changed I made). 
Once, I will have version with working interface, I will make first release (expected in 5-6 weeks)
