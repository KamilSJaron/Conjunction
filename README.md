# forsim
C++ software for forward simualtion

It is main part of the master thesis of mine and it is simulator of genomic admixture on the hybrid zones.
This software is opprational, but it is still in development - there are still some bugs to be repaired.


The software does not take any arguments, it reads the 'setting.txt' file, where all parameters are expected to be found. So, after compilation, user needs only change options in setting file before simulation.

Be sure that you have permission to run the program (chmod u+x forsim).
